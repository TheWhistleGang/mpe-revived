	@RESULTS
	{
		Ki'KiSrfLandedContactPoint = The rocks here are quite tough; it would seem that the material here was compressed heavily when the two lobes came together. You dread having to tell mission control that you broke your sample drill. However, it would seem that both lobes are very similar in composition; they may have formed from the exact same cloud.
		Ki'KiSrfLanded = You're able to easily gather a large regolith sample in the microgravity. Ki'Ki's surface is mainly comprised of various ices and tholins.

		KalSrfLandedLowlands = Kal's lowlands have a very diverse surface, you can barely decide on which rock to choose. The variety of ice, rock, and even some metallic material implies that Kal came together from loose material not long after the collision that made Havous into the strange world it is today.
		KalSrfLandedMountains = The material that makes up these large bumps is almost entirely ice. These solid chunks of material might have at one point been moonlets within Havous' rings before merging with Kal as it moved to its present position.
		KalSrfLandedPeaks = This material is flaky and soft; it's definetly material fresh from Havous' rings. You ask mission control if you can build your own personal ring system with this material. Hours later, you get an annoyed groan.

		FlakeSrfLanded = This region is hard ice, and would be slippery too if the gravity wasn't so low.
		FlakeSrfLandedIce = These highlands are pure, flaky powder. You make sure to take precautions to ensure that your body heat doesn't instantly melt the sample. This material is very similar to that found in rings. Flake must have formed from a long-gone ring system around Mracksis.

		LonSrfLanded = There's a stangely high amount of metal flakes in the ice, which accounts for Lon's strange coloration. The origin of this material however simply creates more questions than answers.
		LonSrfLandedCraters = These craters are coated in a layer of rocky dust.

		MracksisSrfLanded = You'd be hard pressed to find something that wasn't tholins here. This raises questions on how such a massive amount of tholins formed.
		MracksisSrfLandedMaria = There's a fair amount of rock in the ice samples here, and the materials are quite compressed too. It's a wonder these impacts didn't form rings or any large moons.
		MracksisSrfLandedIceFields = Part of you is relieved to find an area that isn't so red. This ice may be newer material, maybe even delivered through the same impacts that so visibly scar the surface.
		MracksisSrfLandedPlanitia = The material here is similar to the majority of Mracksis' surface. It's slightly more compressed here however, this very well could be an impact zone.
		MracksisSrfLandedLesserMare = The material here is similar to the majority of Mracksis' surface. It's slightly more compressed here however, this very well could be an impact zone.

		HavousSrfLanded = This sample is mainly ice, with some trace amounts of rock.
		HavousSrfLandedScar = This area is mostly rocky, but there is still a fair amount of ice.
		HavousSrfLandedPointZero = This is a region of almost purely metamorphic, rocky material. The deposit was likely a direct result of the impact event, and its presence in the middle of the scar, suggests this was the point of impact.
		HavousSrfLandedGlaciers = The sample is entirely ice. There's a strange absense of rocky material, or even the tholins that seem so common in this region of the solar system. Perhaps the glacier's material recycles somehow.
		HavousSrfLandedMontesTimor = This sample is mainly ice, but it's more compressed here.

		ArchaeSrfLanded = This sample is ice, but its been dirtied by darker material. It's a bit sticky.
		ArchaeSrfLandedCrags = This sample is rocky, in fact, it was quite hard to remove.
		ArchaeSrfLandedBigFlat = The ice here is compressed, one could resonably conclude this to be an impact zone.
		ArchaeSrfLandedSmolFlat = The ice here is compressed, one could resonably conclude this to be an impact zone.
		ArchaeSrfLandedBand = The ice here is softer and smoother than on other regions of the planet.
		ArchaeSrfLandedGrandMountains = The sample contains an even amount of rock and ice.

		ErvoSrfLanded = The sample is not as icy as you expected. In fact, you're able to find some chunks that seem to be primarily rock. Any flakes of metallic material are completely rusted over.
		ErvoSrfLandedOxygenLakes = The fact that you're cupping oxygen in your hand is astonishing. It's also beyond freezing so you can't hold onto it for very long. You remark that you should try breathing under oxygen here... only to realize that your joke might result in some panic for mission control in a few hours when your signal reaches them.
		ErvoSrfLandedCoastalBasins = This area contains some fine salts and a lot of water ice. This was likely submerged, but Ervo's oxygen lakes seem to be disappearing, and fast! ...Well, on geological timescales.
		ErvoSrfLandedPoles = This area is mainly frozen oxygen, ammonia, nitrous oxide, and water ice. There's a fair amount of fine salts as well.
		ErvoSrfLandedImpactBasin = The sample has a wide diversity of different ices, some rocky powder, and some crusty rust. It could be that a comet or similar oxygen-rich object impacted this point and delivered the overabundance oxygen to Ervo. However, that just raises more questions about why such an object would've existed.
		ErvoSrfLandedMountains = There's a fair amount of rock here. These mountains seem to suggest that Ervo is geologically active.
		ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = The ice here is layered, and the upper layers are fragile. These glaciers may be cells formed by movement in a small subsurface ocean under this region.
		ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = While collecting a sample, you feel the ground shift. You begin to collect the sample faster.
		ErvoSrfLandedSmoothGlacierField = The ice here is layered, and the upper layers are fragile. These glaciers may be cells formed by movement in a small subsurface ocean under this region.
		ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = The ice here is layered, and the upper layers are fragile. These glaciers may be cells formed by movement in a small subsurface ocean under this region.

		SodenSrfLanded = The sample is a mixture of ice and tholins, but the most striking feature is the color. Its alien beauty is both enthralling and for some reason a bit scary.
		SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = There's a thin layer of powdery water ice here. Occasionally, you can see a flake slowly fall from the sky. This may have been the site of large cryovolcanos at some point in the past. Those subsurface oceans are almost certainly freezing over now.
		SodenSrfLandedMajorGlaciers = The colors of the samples you take are striking. The tholins here are very diverse.
		SodenSrfLandedMinorGlaciers = The colors of the samples you take are striking. The tholins here are very diverse.
		SodenSrfLandedMajorCanyons = There's a layer of dark tholins, but brushing it away reveals a layer of water ice beneath.
		SodenSrfLandedMajorCanyons = There's a layer of tholins here, but brushing it away reveals a layer of several types of ices beneath.

		CrokslevSrfLanded = There's a lot of ice here, but there also seems to be a high clay content.
		CrokslevSrfLandedPoles = The ice content was expected to shoot up here, however there's actually more clay and rock here than anything.
		CrokslevSrfLandedHighlands = There's a good amount of ice in this region, including methane ice.
		CrokslevSrfLandedCraters = There's a fine dust in and around this crater, it wouldn't be hard to deduce the composition of the meteoroid that created it.
		CrokslevSrfLandedRubble = These irregular mounds all seem to have composition that is distinct from the area around them, they're even distinct relative to each other. Perhaps these mounds were at one point seperate objects that integrated into Crokslev's whole.
		CrokslevSrfLandedBigCrater = The dust covering this craters surface is mostly rocky material, and it's quite dark. This material doesn't match that found in the rings at all.
		CrokslevSrfLandedCentralPeak = There's less dust and more ice here, perhaps this region of the craters has held onto the most native material.
		CrokslevSrfLandedFissures = These deep gashes in Crokslev's surface provide insight into deeper layers of its makeup. It's reasonable to conclude based on these samples that Crokslev is undifferentiated.
		CrokslevSrfLandedOriginCrater = There's a fine white powder here, it's mostly water ice. It's composition is identical to that of the rings. This must be where the object that created the rings impacted Crokslev.
		CrokslevSrfLandedSatCraters = The dust in this crater is identical to the other three craters nearby, perhaps they share an impact event.
		CrokslevSrfLandedSouthernPile = These mounds are identical to one another, they must all have the same origin. Though how the object broke up before landing on Crokslev is a mystery. Perhaps the object was broken up by an outer planet, like Sarnus or Urlum? That would imply Crokslev was once much closer to these major planets, perhaps even a moon at some point in its past.

		GeitoSrfLandedLowlands = There's quite a bit of activity in this region, so you make sure to grab the sample quickly. It's mostly water-ice, but closer analysis reveals nucleic acids!
		GeitoSrfLandedMidlands = The samples are mostly chunks of ice, but there are some rocky pebbles among them.
		GeitoSrfLandedMidlands = You're able to grab a piece of ice that began floating off the comet's surface after getting hit with a puff from your RCS pack, the surface level ice here seems loose.

		Lint-MikeyLandedLowlands = There's a large amount of rock and clays here, giving it a darker coloration than the rest of the comet. Ignoring some regional discrepancies, it would seem this object has a fairly consistant composition.
		Lint-MikeyLandedMidlands = The ice here is dirtied by rock and other materials, you take the time to pick out the rocks from the sample so it can be nice and clean. You realize your mistake in changing the composition of the sample and grab another chunk.
		Link-MikeyLandedHighlands = The ices here have a large clay component, giving it a red ting.

		ZoreSrfLandedMetalLowlands = The surface here is covered with large chunks of metal and metallic dust, you make sure to take a good varity of samples. Most of the metal is nickle and iron, but there is some rocky dust scattered around.
		ZoreSrfLandedRockyLowlands = The samples are mostly chunks of rock, with very trace amounts of shiny metals scattered around. This material may be what remains of the smaller asteroids that made the two major craters nearby.
		ZoreSrfLandedRockyHighlands = The rock layer doesn't go very deep before Zore's signature metallic composition is found again. This surface material might not even originally be from Zore, but rather from subsequent impacts by lighter, rockier asteroids.
		ZoreSrfLandedCraters = There's a fine layer of dust, it seems that smaller meteroids here were nearly completely disintegrated, leaving only a thin layer of fine powder in a small crater, while the rest of the material was likely completely lost to the void of space.
		ZoreSrfLandedMajorCraters = These massive bowls expose a region of almost pure iron, among some flakey dust. It's quite difficult to remove a sample even with the help of tools.
		ZoreSrfLandedCraggleField = This chaotic region seems to have an even mixture of rocky and metallic material.

		VantSrfLandedLowlands = There is an icy layer beneath the rocks and dust, it's quite deep, but it does prove directly that Vant is indeed, mainly ice.
		VantSrfLandedHighlands = These polar regions seem to have a thinner rock layer than the rest of Vant, in fact, some areas have ice on the surface!
		VantSrfLandedCanyons = These canyons are mostly silicates, but also have a large ice component as well.
		VantSrfLandedCraters = The dust in these craters can perhaps be used to deduce the type of class of asteroid that created them.
		VantSrfLandedCrags = The samples here are jagged piles of rubble. Perhaps this is the final resting place of a low-velocity "rubble-pile" asteroid.
		VantSrfLandedMudcano = This ancient cryovolcano is coated in a rocky-icy mush, which could be ancient ejecta. This is the closet a cryovolcano to the Sun ever been found.
		VantSrfLandedEquator = This region is mainly rock. The surface is quite smooth, with very little debris.

		QuazenSrfLandedBlue = The surface of this lobe seems to have pockets of sapphire out of the rest of the beryllium. This sapphire must have been dredged up due to geological activity of some sort.
		QuazenSrfLandedMontes = These mountains seem to have much looser rock than the rest of Turq's Lobe; it's essentially a snowy dirtball.
		QuazenSrfLandedSlopes = The rock gets thinner--and slipperier--as you ascend the mountain range.
		QuazenSrfLandedLake = The surface here is covered with sapphires. You pick up the purest one you can find, then realize that you cannot call your jeweler to make a ring. You guess the spouse will have to wait...
		QuazenSrfLandedGold = The surface here seems flaky, like it's covered in powdered sulfur. You think of the smell it will bring about when you return to the ship, and then wonder if the sample came from Pol as well.
		QuazenSrfLandedDivot = There seems to be a bit of sulfur here, but it also is mixied with phosphorus of some kind. There is tons of rock beneath the dusty surface, however.
		QuazenSrfLandedCrater = The rock here seems to be heavily compressed from the violent impact, but it is oddly lacking in the dust that spread to the rest of the hemisphere.
		QuazenSrfLandedInterlobe = Tidal stresses... make this... terrible... to dig into!
		QuazenSrfLandedNorthPole = Whatever body impacted this region had to have left some sort of tholin deposits. But how they survived a body that came from so far away remains to be seen.
		QuazenSrfLandedSouthPole = Some slightly harder rock here, but some that doesn't need phenomonal strength to even make budge.

		EuribanneSrfLandedLowlands = The composition here seems to be similar to ice, though there is still some rock there. It may have come from the same region as Vant.
		EuribanneSrfLandedMidlands = This layer may be mostly dust, with tiny ice crystals throughout.
		EuribanneSrfLandedHighlands = There's a lot to take in here. It's just like shoveling dirt on a construction site, except a lot easier.
		EuribanneSrfLandedCraters = The craters seem a bit icier; perhaps these impacts may have deposited that ice.
		EuribanneSrfLandedDivot = This crater sure was giant. It's filled with ice. No wonder Euribanne's a little off-kilter!
		EuribanneSrfLandedDoubleDouble = These craters seem to be filled with tholins. Perhaps two objects beyond Neidon came here and impacted the object.
		EuribanneSrfLandedChasm = The rock here is much denser than the surrounding material. Did Euribanne shrink during its formation, or was this a product of geological activity?
		EuribanneSrfLandedNorthPole = There's a rich, rich deposit of tholins here... and yet this crater is so deep.
		EuribanneSrfLandedSouthPole = Somewhat icy in composition, as if the Divot caused a major "lava" flow of some kind that later cooled.
		
		EurbonSrfLandedCraters = Deposits of ice at the bottom here. These may have been pretty slow impacts though.
		EurbonSrfLandedLowlands = Still relatively icy, but there's a decent enough layer of rock to keep everything in line.
		EurbonSrfLandedMidlands = This is mainly ice, ice not strong enough to hold boulders or anything along those lines.
		EurbonSrfLandedHighlands = There's a lot more rock here, with some hints of ice. It's still dusty rock, however.
		EurbonSrfLandedPeaks = The ice seems to be partially packed in here, covered instead by large bits of rock.
		EurbonSrfLandedPits = The sample is incredibly sparse here somehow. Whatever formed these pits, it wasn't craters.

		Palloocus-PalloomusSrfLanded = This has to have been beyond the impossible. Please check with the developer for further information.

		PalloocusSrfLandedBloodCrater = It's tholins all the way down.
		PalloocusSrfLandedCraters = Underneath a fresh layer of powdered ice is a layer of tholins.
		PalloocusSrfLandedNorthHemi = A healthy mix of ice and tholins, enough to feed a whole Tektonic family!
		PalloocusSrfLandedSouthHemi = Mostly water ice here, but there's a healthy amount of rock here as well.
		PalloocusSrfLandedCanyon = This entire canyon seems to be less icy than the rest of the area... possibly because ice deposited from the giant impact may not have actually made it down here.
		PalloocusSrfLandedBlue = The ice here is especially thick. Possibly just from where the last bits settled around the area, maybe for rebalancing.
		PalloocusSrfLandedVolcano = This seems to be fresh ice, mostly untouched by cosmic rays and the solar wind. This world must be volcanically active... but how?
		
		PalloomusSrfLandedLowlands = There doesn't seem to be a ton of tholins here; mostly lots of water ice.
		PalloomusSrfLandedMidlands = A thicker layer of tholins here, but scooping some away reveals further water ice beneath.
		PalloomusSrfLandedHighlands = Mass quantities of tholins. Any ice here must have been removed a long time ago.
		PalloomusSrfLandedCraters = There's less tholins here than the surrounding area. These craters must be fairly recent geologically.
		PalloomusSrfLandedCliff = This may not have gotten much ice from Palloocus' collision, strangely enough. And whatever ice is here is extremely packed.
		PalloomusSrfLandedSnowdrifts = This ice is incredibly fresh. Palloocus' collision sure did happen fairly recently.

		EdasSrfLandedSurface = There's a distinct lack of loose material, so you have to chip a piece off of Edas. The sample is entirely silicates.
		EdasSrfLandedCraters = Breaking a piece off in this region shows that it's nearly identical to the rest of Edas in composition. mMst foreign material was likely blown into space.
		EdasSrfLandedPolarCrater = There's a trace amount of carbonaceous material here as an extremely thin layer on the crater's bowl. You scrape off a bit of the powder, this could be material from the asteroid that made this crater.
		
		DopplerSrfLandedCrater = This doesn't seem like rust... more like tholins, which can only form out near the region of, say, Mracksis...
		DopplerSrfLandedMainland = Somewhat of a mix of rust and tholins. Kinda hard to chip through.
		DopplerSrfLandedEquator = This seems to be made of ice, mixed with some silver and other metals for good measure.
		
		DyvaSrfLandedMajorLobe = It's very crumbly. Just like a butter cookie.
		DyvaSrfLandedMinorLobe = It's very crumbly. Just like a butter cookie.
		DyvaSrfLandedContactPoint = This is kind of dense, but not much denser than the lobes.

	@RESULTS
	{
		Ki'KiInSpaceLow = As you orbit, Ki'Ki's surface slowly approches and then recedes as you pass over the lobes. You make sure to triple check your telemetry, you wouldn't want to crash.
		Ki'KiInSpaceHigh = Ki'Ki's odd shape makes it look as though it's two objects close together from some angles, and a bone-shape from other angles. You make note of the idea that this may be a contact-binary.
		Ki'KiSrfLandedContactPoint = The two lobes of Ki'Ki take up large portions of the sky on either side of your craft, the thought of Ki'Ki's lobes suddenly collapsing in on you crosses your mind. You speed up your surface operations.
		Ki'KiSrfLanded = Ki'Ki's surface is quite chaotic, you had trouble finding flat ground to land on.

		KalInSpaceHigh = Kal's diamond shape and proximity to Havous' rings makes it look like a very appealing location. You make sure to take a picture at your earliest convenience.
		KalInSpaceLow = You notice several large boulders, it seems finding level ground for a landing may be difficult. 
		KalSrfLandedLowlands = You feel as though you could've found a better place to touch down, it's so rugged here.
		KalSrfLandedMountains = The ship's engine vaporized some of the ice below the ship, but otherwise this is a nice vantage point.
		KalSrfLandedPeaks = You noticed while landing that the ground here gave a little bit. This region must not be very solid.

		HavousInSpaceHigh = Havous is seems quite beautiful, you cross your fingers for a closer look.
		HavousInSpaceHigh = The bright colors and arching rings, along with Havous' famous oblate shape, create a beautiful, if not unnerving sight. All signs point towards an ancient disaster.
		HavousInSpaceLow = The rings are very pretty up close, but you're nervous whenever you hear a small ice particle hit the side of your craft.
		HavousInSpaceLow = You hear a thunk and check for any holes in the ship. There's no hole, but you're startled none the less.
		HavousSrfLanded = Looking out the window makes you feel a little sickly, the sky is visibly moving.
		HavousSrfLandedMontesTimor = The view out the window shows a chaotic landscape, you're very eager to get out and stretch your legs.
		HavousSrfLandedScar = The targeted landing to get to this ancient impact zone was difficult to plan due to Havous' rotation. You feel happy that you managed to get here.
		HavousSrfLandedPointZero = The targeted landing to get to the exact sight of an ancient impact was very difficult to plan due to Havous' rotation. You feel very accomplished that you managed to land here.

		FlakeInSpaceHigh = Flake looks very puffy, even up close.
		FlakeInSpaceLow = Flake's surface is lumpy yet smoothed, the occasional cracks look like appealing landing challenges.
		FlakeSrfLanded = You might as well not even be near an object with gravity, let alone on one. Everything is still very much floating.
		FlakeSrfLandedCracks = This canyon is quite a pretty location, but you decide this view out the window alone might not have been worth the long trip out here.

		MracksisInSpaceHigh = Mracksis is just as vibrant as they promised that it would be.
		MracksisInSpaceHigh = Mracksis' disk grows as you approch the planet, revealing features that remind you of the Mun.
		MracksisInSpaceLow = Mracksis' surface seems more diverse than you expected, those dark circular regions may be the sight of ancient impacts.
		MracksisInSpaceLow = You hear a soft thud on the side of your ship, there seem to be some small micrometeorites around Mracksis.
		MracksisSrfLanded = The resued Mun landing training simulation that you went through before launch makes sense now. Aside from the vastly different terrain of course.
		MracksisSrfLandedGlaciers = This area is a lot brighter than the rest of Mracksis, you make to block your eyes before looking out the window.
		MracksisSrfLandedMaria = You think about how you're not technically the first thing to land in this region, you're only the first to do it gently. You make a nervous glance out the window, hopefully nothing else "lands" here during your stay on the surface.

		LonInSpaceHigh = Lon's odd shape has earned a fair few stares even before getting close to it. It almost feels like it's a cruel joke that after such a long travel you've been met with such a ridiculous object.
		LonInSpaceLow = The oblong shape of Lon makes you nervous as you ensure that you're not going to run into it. The shape doesn't seem so strange up close.
		LonSrfLanded = You see Soden through the window and smile. This is quite a nice vantage point.
		LonSrfLanded = Landing was probably the easiest part of this mission.
		LonSrfLanded = You see the sun through the window, and suddenly you wish you were back home.

		SodenInSpaceHigh = Mission control assures you that you are indeed approching Soden, and that you're actually in its SOI. You cannot see it though, no matter how hard you squint.
		SodenInSpaceHigh = You can just about make out Soden if you squint hard enough, but you're nearly pressing your eye against the glass to do so.
		SodenInSpaceHigh = What you can see of Soden is quite interesting. You can't wait for a closer look after several years of nothing.
		SodenInSpaceLow = Soden's surface has a shocking amount of diversity, with its island-like glaciers, vibrant colors, and deep trenches.
		SodenInSpaceLow = You wonder how deep the canyons go, and what secrets they might hold.
		SodenSrfLanded = Landing this craft made you feel like you summited the highest mountain on Kerbin a thousand times over. This is the furthest dwarf planet known, and now your craft is standing on it. You are filled with pride, and maybe a bit of fear, knowing how far you've come.
		SodenSrfLandedMajorCanyons = Watching the sides of the canyon creep up on either side of you was an intense adrenaline rush.
		SodenSrfLandedMinorCanyons = Watching the sides of the canyon creep up on either side of you was quite the adrenaline rush.
		SodenSrfLandedMajorGlaciers = You sit back in your seat and sigh. This has been quite the long wait, and now you're here.
		SodenSrfLandedMinorGlaciers = You've summited the Kerbolar System, and you're definetly going to brag about it.
		SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = You feel a rumble coming from underground.

		ArchaeInSpaceHigh = Archae's chaotic surface implies a chaotic history. Ever since scientists back home began getting good looks at the small moon, it's been suspected that it may not have formed around Ervo at all.
		ArchaeInSpaceLow = The surface isn't as dark as you anticipated, which is more than relieving. You take plenty of time to look over the interesting terrain features and toss around a few explainations.
		ArchaeSrfLanded = Some have speculated that Archae once fell apart and reformed, which is why its surface is so chaotic. You hope it stays together during your stay.
		ArchaeSrfLandedCrags = You feel as though you could've found a more level area to land in.
		ArchaeSrfLandedBigFlat = You feel as though you've just landed on Minmus' distant, darker cousin.
		ArchaeSrfLandedBigFlat = This region is very flat, aside from the scattered craters.
		ArchaeSrfLandedSmolFlat = This region is very flat, aside from the scattered craters.
		ArchaeSrfLandedBand = This region stuck out to you instantly, what could possibly account for this? Tidal forces? Resurfacing? An ancient impact event? Perhaps your time here will uncover some answers.
		ArchaeSrfLandedGrandMountains = You hope these mountains have incredible views.
		ArchaeSrfLandedGrandMountains = The presence of mountains like this has implications on Archae's geologic past. Perhaps it was once active?

		ErvoInSpaceHigh = You're reminded that Ervo is the reason behind the demotion of Plock, and you feel an slight irrational resentment because of that. Then you remember that Ervo is the reason behind Dres' promotion to a dwarf planet. You can't tell if that makes you angrier or not.
		ErvoInSpaceHigh = Many scientists considered manned missions to Ervo impractical. Time to prove them wrong... hopefully.
		ErvoInSpaceHigh = You keep glancing out the window for another glimpse at Ervo, exploring a new world is always exciting.
		ErvoInSpaceHigh = From afar, it is quite easy to track the periodic motion of Archae as it orbits Ervo. The more precise that charts of Archae's orbit become, the better one can estimate the mass of Ervo.
		ErvoInSpaceLow = Occasionally, you can spot a lone small cloud. These clouds typically appear around the equator, and they don't last long before they precipitate.
		ErvoInSpaceLow = Ervo's surface is beautifully diverse. Observations have proven that Ervo is in fact geologically active.
		ErvoInSpaceLow = The shadow of Archae among the stars as it orbits Ervo is a little intimidating.
		ErvoFlyingHigh = The fact that Ervo has an atmosphere is stange to you, but it's been known to exist for a long time now.
		ErvoFlyingLow = There's a strong oxygen component in the thin air. You're tempted to try and breath it in, but remember that mission control told you specifically not to do so.
		ErvoSrfLanded = You made it. Who knows what you'll discover on this new horizon.
		ErvoSrfLanded = The atmosphere had more of an effect than you expected during the landing, and creates a lovely haze along the horizon.
		ErvoSrfSplashed = As the craft floats, any metal that can rust, does. You hope that doesn't affect the craft's functionality.
		ErvoSrfLandedPoles = The ground made a small crunching sound when you touched down. 
		ErvoSrfLandedMountains = Now this is a view. You make sure to check the enviroment before heading out to stretch your legs.
		ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = You've been told these glaciers are more likely cells created by local subsurface lakes. There could be a very important discovery waiting here.
		ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = You feel what you suspect to be a small tremor. Well, there's your confirmation that at least something is moving beneath the surface.
		ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = You've been told these glaciers are more likely cells created by local subsurface lakes. There could be a very important discovery waiting here.
		ErvoSrfLandedSmoothGlacierField = You've been told these glaciers are more likely cells created by local subsurface lakes. There could be a very important discovery waiting here.
		ErvoSrfLandedImpactBasin = This is definetly an impact basin, not dramatic enough to be responsible for Archae's formation. However, some suspect a comet hit Ervo in this very location.
		ErvoSrfLandedCoastalBasins = You're excited for the beach, but then you remember it's not water. Nevertheless, the view should be well worth it.

		CrokslevInSpaceHigh = You can make out the shape of the centaur through your window. It's rounder than you expected, which is a welcome suprise. The rings are thin and delicate.
		CrokslevInSpaceLow = You can't help but feel that your pictures might stir up the Kerbal Astronomical Society a bit. Crokslev's rounded shape suggests it's in equilibrium, meaning it would be a very small dwarf planet instead of a fairly large asteroid.
		CrokslevInSpaceLowBigCrater = This crater was named after the astronomer who discovered Crokslev, his name forms the latter half of the object's offical name.
		CrokslevInSpaceLowCentralPeak = This central peak was named after the astronomer who discovered Crokslev's rings, his name now forms the former half of the object's offical name.
		CrokslevSrfLanded = You can't help but feel that your stay at Crokslev won't be nearly as bad as it sounded during briefing. Your daydreams are interrupted by a random buzzer that you can't pinpoint. 

		GietoInSpaceHigh = You feel pride as you approch the most famous comet known to Kerbalkind, but you're not sure you want to get too close.
		GietoInSpaceLow = You hear the patter of particles falling off Gieto hitting the sides of the space craft.
		GietoSrfLanded = Your not sure if you can truly "land" on an object with such weak gravity.

		Lint-MikeyInSpaceHigh = You had never heard of 68P/Lint-Mikey before you were briefed on this mission, but once you get a good look at its shape, you have a feeling its going to become a lot more well known.
		Lint-MikeyInSpaceLow = This object could be a contact-binary, but how two comets came together when they have such weak gravity is anyone's guess.
		Lint-MikeySrfLanded = You thought that "less gravity" means "easier landing." Now you worry you can't even walk without drifting off into space.

		ZoreInSpaceHigh = Zore's distant image is visible in the window. It's quite a strange looking world, with some very large craters visible already.
		ZoreInSpaceLow = Zore's gravity seems a bit high for an object its size. When noting this to mission control, they remind you that Zore is metallic, not rocky, thus has a higher density and gravity than usual objects in its size-range. They also remind you that's the entire reason you were sent here.
		ZoreSrfLanded = Landing on Zore was very easy to pull off, but it was difficult to find level ground to land on, not that that matters in such low gravity of course.
		ZoreSrfLandedMajorCraters = It was a little scary to watch the crater's bowl rise in the craft's windows, but ultimately harmless.
		ZoreSrfLandedCraggleField = The surface here is quite chaotic. Finding a landing site was difficult, but that's not much different than the rest of Zore.

		VantInSpaceHigh = Even from here, Vant looks far less irregular than most asteroids, no doubt due to its mass.
		VantInSpaceLow = Though the colors aren't very exciting, Vant has a multitude of diverse regions and many large craters.
		VantSrfLandedHighlands = These highlands were denoted as such after a team of researchers denoted and offical shape for Vant, which placed these regions are particularly far above that base shape, despite the fact that they are closer to the center of mass.
		VantSrfLandedLowlands = Vant's surface is rough, but it could be far worse based on what you hear about most asteroids.
		VantSrfLandedMudcano = You know that this cryvolcano is inactive, and has been for a very long time, but the idea of it suddenly erupting is rather frightening.
		VantSrfLandedValleys = These valleys are amazing! Though, this raises questions on where they might've come from. Obviously, Vant couldn't have had any bodies of liquid in the past, but perhaps Vant was geologically active in relatively recent history?
		VantSrfLandedCraters = Vant is fairly good at clearing up some of the larger objects in its region, with the obvious exceptions of Dres, Zore, and Quazen of course. The real question is did these objects hit Vant, or did Vant hit them? That doesn't really matter, but it's fun to think about.
		VantSrfLandedCrags = Lots of mountains are tightly packed together here, who knows where they came from.
		VantSrfLandedEquator = The subtle rills of this equatorial depression made it quite an appealing region to visit.

		QuazenInSpaceHigh = The body is quite the double-headed jewel. Visiting here is going to be very, very interesting...
		QuazenInSpaceLow = You see glints from minerals speckled across Turq's Lobe, especially within Lago Stravinsky.]
		QuazenSrfLanded = Wow. What a ride here.
		QuazenSrfLandedBlue = It's blue and white all over. You're suddenly green... well, greener... with envy.
		QuazenSrfLandedMontes = From this vantage point, both lobes of Quazen are visible. The contrast is incredible!
		QuazenSrfLandedSlopes = The peaks are so white from here...
		QuazenSrfLandedLake = There is water at the bottom of the ocean; there is sapphire at the bottom of the lake. How?!
		QuazenSrfLandedGold = The rocket engines must have kicked up some dust from the surface; it's floating all around you.
		QuazenSrfLandedDivot = The rocket engines must have kicked up some dust from the surface; it's floating all around you.
		QuazenSrfLandedCrater = Here you see one of the deepest craters ever seen. How Quazen didn't fall apart after this is a mystery for the ages.
		QuazenSrfLandedInterlobe = Between the blue and the gold... is just a plain field of gray.
		QuazenSrfLandedNorthPole = A red north pole, huh? It feels like Festivus has returned.
		QuazenSrfLandedSouthPole = We don't really know what went on here, but the craters seemed to be shaped like teardrops. Somewhat like the tears you cried after finally managing to reach the body...

		EuribanneInSpaceHigh = As the asteroid spins ever-so-slowly, you find it's somewhat off-kilter. You don't know why exactly, but it does make you somewhat uneasy.
		EuribanneInSpaceHigh = The views of Jool from here are spectacular, even if it's only half as bright as it normally should be.
		EuribanneInSpaceLow = Orbiting around here, with teeny little Eurbon nearby, makes the whole ride here worth it. This despite the fact that this asteroid is barely any bigger than Gilly.
		EuribanneSrfLanded = This landing reminds you of a landing on Gilly. Gilly, but icy...
		EuribanneSrfLandedDivot = This place might be a bit slippery once you go on EVA. It doesn't look like a very safe place.
		EuribanneSrfLandedNorthPole = Dark, dark in the daytime. You miss Eurbon.
		EuribanneSrfLandedChasm = You don't know how you landed here. Or how this even got here. It's the strangest place in the system yet.

		EurbonInSpaceHigh = This moon rotates slowly, but it's a welcome sight compared to the sluggishness that is Euribanne's rotation.
		EurbonInSpaceLow = It's a cute little moon, sure, but there isn't much to see. It could be a fragment from a collision that may have caused Euribanne's divot.
		EurbonSrfLanded = It's kind of flat and smooth, but not too hard to see. Not very bouldery.
		EurbonSrfLandedCraters = These are somewhat icy. You're lucky these may have been low-velocity impacts; otherwise they would have shattered the moon altogether.
		EurbonSrfLandedPeaks = These are lighter for some reason than the mainland. Why that is remains to be seen.
		EurbonSrfLandedPits = You're way in deep. It's a miracle you even landed in here.

		Palloocus-PalloomusInSpaceHigh = Palloocus and Palloomus slowly orbit around each other, both keeping one face to each other. Just like dancing twins.
		PalloocusInSpaceHigh = The views of Jool from here are spectacular, even if it's only half as bright as it normally should be.
		Palloocus-PalloomusInSpaceLow = Right in between the twin Trojans. You can't believe how two bodies could be so different and yet be entwined together so much.
		Palloocus-PalloomusSrfLanded = This shouldn't happen. Please check with the developer for further information.

		PalloocusInSpaceHigh = The red Palloomus looms over you as you look at Palloocus. You wonder how it is that two incredibly different bodies could end up so close together.
		PalloocusInSpaceLow = McCartney Montes and Sangue Crater especially stand out to you. Whatever volcanism there was must have been driven by the impact.
		PalloocusSrfLanded = Whatever you might have landed in is too fluffy to think about. It's like fresh powder.
		PalloocusSrfLandedBloodCrater = This may be the reddest place in the Solar System, even moreso than Duna. But hey, at least Duna's easier to reach.
		PalloocusSrfLandedCanyon = This is certainly an odd place to land, but the vistas from here are still pretty nice.
		PalloocusSrfLandedVolcano = The light here would be blinding if this were any closer to the Sun. Though the reflection of the light would honestly be the least of your worries...
		
		PalloomusInSpaceHigh = High above the red asteroid, you see its white brother not far away. It's a striking difference.
		PalloomusInSpaceLow = That cliff sure seems to be tall. It shouldn't be too drastic of a drop though.
		PalloomusSrfLanded = All around you is red. Dark, dark red. It's a pleasant red though, like cake.
		PalloomusSrfLandedLowlands = It's kinda brighter here in comparison, possibly because of the icy ejecta nearby.
		PalloomusSrfLandedCliff = It's such a long way down.
		PalloomusSrfLandedSnowdrifts = It's really fresh ice here, almost powdery. Some of it sublimated from the heat of the rocket.

		EdasInSpaceHigh = You're glad you found Edas before it was destroyed or perturbed by Duna. Not that there was any chance of that of course, just good to be ready for anything.
		EdasInSpaceLow = While Edas is a notable asteroid compared to the usual ones found around Kerbin, it seems to share the same general features, irregular shape, smooth surface, scattered craters, and so on.
		EdasSrfLandedSurface = The surface is very smooth on Edas; you wonder if its gravity is just too weak to hold onto boulders.
		EdasSrfLandedCraters = These craters are very smooth, and impact ejecta, dust, and debris was blown back into interplanetary space.
		EdasSrfLandedPolarCrater = This is the largest crater on Edas, and the asteroid that made it probably wouldn't even make it through Kerbin's atmosphere.
		
		DopplerInSpaceHigh = It's really, really red... like Duna's polar opposite.
		DopplerInSpaceLow = From this vantage point, the surface seems more like powder, like a really thick strawberry cookie.
		DopplerSrfLandedCrater = The dust flew off as you landed. What is this on here?
		DopplerSrfLandedMainland = Looks somewhat dusty here. Whatever's here must be really rubbly.
		DopplerSrfLandedEquator = Too powdery here. Almost like snow... so how come it hasn't sublimated?
		
		DyvaInSpaceHigh = With Doppler in the background, you can't help but see this as an odd sort of moon.
		DyvaInSpaceLow = You don't know how two asteroids could have come together at such a tiny speed, let alone come into orbit around another asteroid.
		DyvaSrfLandedMajorLobe = The ground buckles a bit under the ship. Whatever kind of surface this is, it's pretty darn smooth.
		DyvaSrfLandedMinorLobe = The ground buckles a bit under the ship. Whatever kind of surface this is, it's pretty darn smooth.
		DyvaSrfLandedContactPoint = How you landed between these two lobes is a mystery for the ages.

	@RESULTS
	{
		Ki'KiInSpaceHigh = You look around, and find yourself staring at Havous, and then at Ki'Ki. What luck that two strange objects happen to exist so close together.
		Ki'KiInSpaceLow = Ki'Ki's shape is fascinating. You wonder how many objects like Ki'Ki exist outside the orbit of distant dwarf planets.
		Ki'KiSrfLanded = You stand on the rugged surface, and glance up at Havous. This is a strange frontier. How many people even knew that Havous and its moons existed before your mission here?
		Ki'KiSrfLandedContactPoint = This region is fun, the massive lobes on either side of you dominate the sky. You know they're stable in place, but you're still uneasy.

		KalInSpaceHigh = This is a lovely view, but you don't want to wander too far from your ship.
		KalInSpaceLow = Kal almost seems as though it was made out of random chunks it picked up from the rings of Havous.
		KalSrfLanded = Kal's lumpy surface stretches... not very far. It's quite small, and you can still tell even while standing on it. Or is that just because you saw it from space and can't get its size out of your head?
		KalSrfLandedMountains = Havous dominates the sky, along with its arching rings. You look out at the rugged land scape. Beautiful yet desolate.
		KalSrfLandedPeaks = The ground's color here matches Havous' rings. Perhaps they're connected.

		HavousInSpaceHigh = The Havous system is strangely beautiful to watch. You try not to wander too far from your ship; it's been your home for awhile now, and you don't want to lose it because of your enthrallment.
		HavousInSpaceLow = You're sure to avoid getting hit with particles from the rings, but you do make sure to grab some if it's safe.
		HavousSrfLanded = The view of Havous' rings and moons overhead is quite astonishing.
		HavousSrfLanded = You wonder if you could make something out of the loose ice here.
		HavousSrfLandedScar = Knowing that you're standing on the location where another dwarf planet impacted Havous is quite alarming for some reason.
		HavousSrfLandedPointZero = You're standing at the exact location where Havous and another dwarf planet touched. The rings, moons, and Havous' rapid spin are all likely the result of that impact.
		HavousSrfLandedMontesTimor = The view is simply incredible.

		FlakeInSpaceHigh = You are wary about going on EVA; micrometeorites seem to be common around Flake's orbit.
		FlakeInSpaceLow = You watch as the surface of Flake moves below you. You could probably get down to the surface and back again with your EVA fuel alone.
		FlakeSrfLanded = You want to hug Flake and squeeze Flake and... wish it were called George for some reason.
		FlakeSrfLandedCracks = This is a lovely view, you can't wait to show your friends and family the photos. Of course, they'll probably already have seen it.
		FlakeSrfLandedPoles = You're on top of a very small world.

		MracksisInSpaceHigh = You put up a thumb and watch as Mracksis disappears behind it. You do the same to Kerbol. You feel a bit sad, so you move your thumb out of the way.
		MracksisInSpaceLow = Mracksis is beautiful. You almost forget that you might end up getting hit by a micrometeorite.
		MracksisSrfLanded = You begin to say something inspirational, but find yourself suddenly cut off by a feeling of isolation. Kerbol is smaller than Flake in the sky.
		MracksisSrfLanded = You sit down and look up, realizing that Mracksis isn't even the last frontier of the Kerbolar System is both exciting and terrifying. You look at the bright specks of the giant planets near Kerbol.
		MracksisSrfLandedMaria = These craters remind you of those on the Mun. You find that you actually miss the Mun quite a bit.

		LonInSpace = Serenity.
		LonSrfLanded = Soden's orb in the sky is beautifully inspiring. It reminds you of what it was like to imagine landing the Mun as a child. You've gone a lot further than the Mun now.
		LonSrfLanded = As you sit and consider the isolation of Soden and its lone moon, you find it strange that Soden only has the one. It has a massive SOI, yet only one moon. You trace the sky with your eyes, wondering if anything else is out there.

		SodenInSpaceHigh = You hum to yourself. No one else hears you.
		SodenInSpaceHigh = Kerbol looks like any other star, you may be approaching the limits of this solar system, but who knows. Maybe one day, Kerbal-kind will venture further.
		SodenInSpaceHigh = During your EVA operations, you stop to glance at Soden and Lon. What secrets could they hold?
		SodenInSpaceLow = Splendid. Soden's beauty is either geniune or a result of the journey out here leaving you begging to see anything.
		SodenSrfLanded = You kick a small stone and watch it disappear into the distance. You feel a bad.
		SodenSrfLanded = You put your arms on your hips in pride as you find a good place to place a flag. You've made it.
		SodenSrfLandedMajorCanyons = You look around and wonder where these canyons came from. Perhaps Soden was more active at some point in its past.
		SodenSrfLandedMinorCanyons = You look around and wonder where these canyons came from. Perhaps Soden was more active at some point in its past.

		ArchaeInSpaceLowBand = Archae's strange, flat band seems to call out to you. Where did it come from? It's a weird ring-like feature around the moon... ring... hmm. You're sure to write that down.
		ArchaeInSpaceHigh = What a view! You try to get Archae and Ervo in the same shot just to appreciate how different they are from one another.
		ArchaeInSpaceLow = You note the amount of craters on Archae rivals every other object beyond Neidon. This further adds to the mystery of Archae's origin.
		ArchaeInSpaceLow = You wonder if Archae really is from this part of the solar system.
		ArchaeSrfLanded = You take a moment of ease. Landing is stressful, especially after such a long trip. You take a moment to enjoy the dark landscape of Ervo's lone moon.

		ErvoInSpaceHigh = You take a moment to consider every previous mission you can remember. From the Mun, to Neidon, to Plock, to beyond, the space program just keeps going further. You look at the stars, and wonder how far away they truly are.
		ErvoInSpaceHigh = You stare at Ervo and Archae in the distance. They're almost tanquil.
		ErvoInSpaceLow = Floating among these distant objects is somewhat comforting, as if you're paying a visit to an old friend.
		ErvoFlying = You really want to get back into the craft. Risking your life after such a long voyage makes you anxious.
		ErvoSrfLanded = Now this is a nice vantage point. You look at Kerbol and realize you can see everyone's house from here.
		ErvoSrfLanded = What wonders await us here?
		ErvoSrfLanded = You wonder if people will ever live in bases, or even colonies, on worlds beyond Plock. You chuckle, there's no way someone would be that crazy. Right?
		ErvoSrfSplashed = This is freezing cold and by extension not very fun. You no longer want to swim in Ervo's lakes.
		ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = You let your mind wonder and begin to think aloud about the idea that Ervo might host life beneath its surface, quite controversally. You make several headlines beacuse of this.
		ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = You feel the ground shake, and you no longer want to be here.
		ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = How far would you have to drill to reach the liquid beneath these cells?
		ErvoSrfLandedSmoothGlacierField = You let your mind wonder and begin to think aloud about the idea that Ervo might host life beneth its surface. You make several headlines because of this.
		ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = You let your mind wonder and begin to think aloud about the idea that Ervo might host life beneth its surface. You make several headlines because of this.
		ErvoSrfLandedMountains = You get an eye full of the view. You're inspired by the landscape, and optimistic that your mission will inspire more people to join in your footsteps.
		ErvoSrfLandedCoastalBasins = You can't wait to go for a swim, but then again, it's not going to be very pleasant.

		CrokslevInSpaceHigh = As you check the status of your craft, you can't help but glance at Crokslev. It's like an island in a vast black sea. Mission Control tells you to stop daydreaming.
		CrokslevInSpaceLow = The rings are larger than what can be seen with the naked eye, several more, very thin rings glimmer in the sun's light.
		CrokslevSrfLanded = You wish you had a telescope; Sarnus and Urlum must be beautiful from here. You feel a little dizzy at the idea of seeing Kerbin from out here, only to identify a blue dot near the sun.
		CrokslevSrfLandedCentralPeak = You declare yourself king of a very small world.
		CrokslevSrfLandedRubble = This is a nice field of lumps.
		CrokslevSrfLandedSouthernPile = This is a very nice field of lumps.
		CrokslevSrfLandedFissures = These cracks put Dres' canyon to shame.
		CrokslevSrfLandedPoles = You're a little sad that the rings aren't easily visible here, but with gravity so low, it wouldn't be hard to fly up for a peak.

		GietoInSpaceHigh = When this comet gets to peribol, it's going to be quite a show for everyone on Kerbin... hopefully.
		GietoInSpaceLow = This feels dangerous. You have to dodge any particularly large pieces of comet ejecta.
		GietoSrfLanded = Planting a flag on a comet sure feels like a bragging right... until you consider how long the flag would even last there.

		Lint-MikeyInSpaceHigh = You wonder how long this comet will last, and if it will ever put on a particularly good show for your friends on Kerbin.
		Lint-MikeyInSpaceLow = You're a little nervous about the hitting the comet as it rotates beneath you, but when you realize how slow you're going your fears are eased, mostly.
		Lint-MikeySrfLanded = You don't feel like you've landed on Lint-Mikey, more that you've approached a large rock and put your feet lightly against it.

		ZoreInSpaceHigh = The situation is nominal, and Zore looks like a very interesting place to visit, even from here. It's strange to think about Dres, Vant, and Quazen being so relatively close yet so very different.
		ZoreInSpaceLow = Zore has a quite chaotic surface, occasionally interupted by large craters or gashes. Watching it slowly move as you orbit it is quite entertaining, but you need to focus on the mission.
		ZoreSrfLandedRockyLowlands = The dust is getting everywhere, easily kicked up by your bounds across the surface.
		ZoreSrfLandedMetalLowlands = You have to watch your steps, the surface is covered in chaotic rocks. Tripping isn't an issue, but puncturing your spacesuit is.
		ZoreSrfLandedRockyHighlands = You have to watch your steps, the surface is covered in chaotic rocks. Tripping isn't an issue, but puncturing your spacesuit is.
		ZoreSrfLandedCraters = The dust is getting everywhere, easily kicked up by your stroll across the surface.
		ZoreSrfLandedMajorCraters = This area is actually very smooth and solid compared to the rest of Zore's surface. Not many large rocks or debris to be seen.
		ZoreSrfLandedCraggleField = You have to watch your steps, the surface is covered in chaotic rocks, some of which are quite jagged. Tripping isn't an issue, but puncturing your spacesuit is.

		VantInSpaceHigh = You were a little scared to step out of your spacecraft, knowing that this is the asteroid belt. However, looking around you see only one, very large asteroid, which of course is Vant. You feel as though those old space operas betrayed you.
		VantInSpaceLow = Vant's valleys look like exciting places to send rovers, though you're not sure wheeled rovers would be practical on such a small object.
		VantSrfLandedHighlands = You squint as hard as you can, and can't make out any other asteroids nearby. Mission control assures you this is entirely normal, asteroids are quite spread out afterall. That doesn't stop you from feeling a little disappointed however.
		VantSrfLandedLowlands = The gravity is very low here. This may be the largest asteroid in size, but it's certainly not the most massive.
		VantSrfLandedCraters = These craters are a good sign that Vant, indeed, is in the asteroid belt, and has suffered many impacts because of it.
		VantSrfLandedValleys = These valleys might be fun to set up a race through, though that also sounds dangerous.
		VantSrfLandedCrags = You have to watch your step to avoid any particularly jagged rocks, puncturing your spacesuit would not be fun.
		VantSrfLandedEquator = This is quite a smooth region, though it's hilly, there's not many rocks or chunks around here.

		QuazenInSpaceHigh = Quazen is an incredibly strange beast. It looks like a bunch of random materials got clubbed together with a stick.
		QuazenInSpaceLow = Glints of light from the lake-like region. Is this water?
		QuazenSrfLandedBlue = All you can see is just... blue. You then start humming some old song to yourself.
		QuazenSrfLandedMontes = You can jump off pretty high and see both of the lobes. The gravity must be really strong in the interlobe regions.
		QuazenSrfLandedSlopes = The footsteps are starting to have some give. It's getting fluffy up here...
		QuazenSrfLandedLake = On Kerbin, these sapphires would have either been crushed underneath you or cut you up like a bunch of tiny knives. Here, it's kind of like a really bouncy gravel trail.
		QuazenSrfLandedGold = You kick up some dust from the surface, but it does at least rain back down. You wipe some off your helmet.
		QuazenSrfLandedDivot = Here the dust is somewhat light; at neck depth, you'll hit bedrock.
		QuazenSrfLandedCrater = The towering cliffs from the crater are ridiculous vistas. You take a photo just for personal enjoyment.
		QuazenSrfLandedInterlobe = You can feel yourself getting heavier here. It must be a major achievement to be able to walk up to either of the lobes.
		QuazenSrfLandedNorthPole = Yes, just like Festivus.
		QuazenSrfLandedSouthPole = Like tears in rain.

		EuribanneInSpaceHigh = It's a teeny little asteroid with a teeny little moon, with a teeny speed of rotation. You wonder why you even came out here in lieu of Jool.
		EuribanneInSpaceLow = Euribanne certainly is a strange little thing. It's almost like Bop, except small. Maybe it was a fragment?
		EuribanneSrfLanded = There's a pretty big layer of dust and rocks here. A bit like snow in a way, except it doesn't give when you try to walk on it.
		EuribanneSrfLandedDivot = You're lucky your boots are designed for traction. One wrong step and you could be slipping and falling. Not onto the asteroid, but around it.
		EuribanneSrfLandedChasm = What a view, what a view, what an imposing view! You can't help but take a picture.
		EuribanneSrfLandedNorthPole = You can't see a thing from here. It's like a mini Mohole.
		EuribanneSrfLandedCraters = Ever-so-subtly icy here. Ice is nice.
		EuribanneSrfLandedDoubleDouble = These craters are rather red, and rather big. It reminds you of the snowkerbs you used to build.
		
		EurbonInSpaceHigh = You see an odd-looking face here on the moon. Even despite the spongy look, it's still somewhat cute.
		EurbonInSpaceLow = This moon is too cute to not love. You snap a picture for the memes, and for a funeral picture when it inevitably decays into Euribanne.
		EurbonSrfLanded = This is kind of a normal little lump of rock... well, aside from the deep pits and the incredible views of Euribanne.
		EurbonSrfLandedCraters = The rims are pretty nice from here. Not too big, not too small. Euribannerise must be exiting...
		EurbonSrfLandedPeaks = Euribanne looks amazing from here. You would jump for joy, but then you'd be on an escape trajectory.
		EurbonSrfLandedPits = You're in a hole you can't dig yourself out of. But you can jump out of it.

		Palloocus-PalloomusInSpaceHigh = Despite their differences, these twins seem to love each other. It's a cute dance.
		Palloocus-PalloomusInSpaceLow = On one side is Palloocus, on the other Palloomus. You love the duality here.
		Palloocus-PalloomusSrfLanded = How did we get here? Please check with the developer for further information.

		PalloocusInSpaceHigh = Palloocus is nearly pure white. Incredible. It has to be fresh ice... at least, geologically fresh ice.
		PalloocusInSpaceLow = You think about trying to skid to a halt in the ice... and then you realize you thought it out loud. Mission Control is going to have a field day...
		PalloocusSrfLandedBloodCrater = You feel like you're climbing to the poles of Duna right now... and then you realize the poles are all around you.
		PalloocusSrfLandedCraters = These are nice places to relax. They feel really fluffy, whether they be from tholins or otherwise.
		PalloocusSrfLandedNorthHemi = It's pretty pink up here. You brush away the ice, see a thick layer of tholins.
		PalloocusSrfLandedSouthHemi = Why, this is almost like a dirty snowball. If only you could make one.
		PalloocusSrfLandedCanyon = You love the vistas here. You try to look for Euribanne from here, only to find nothing.
		PalloocusSrfLandedBlue = You're green. But you still feel blue here. You like the blue ice. It's almost glowing here.
		PalloocusSrfLandedVolcano = These volcanoes are towering over you, but they're still somewhat easy climbs due to the low gravity. You wonder if you could ride a wave of liquid water, if it were to come out.

		PalloomusInSpaceHigh = This is strikingly red. Shockingly red, even. It's like you took a giant handful of cake and plopped it in space.
		PalloomusInSpaceLow = You think of that cliff, and how far it would take you to fall down that, at least when compared to on Kerbin.
		PalloomusSrfLanded = The redness hasn't changed one bit here. It's just like Palloocus' crater.
		PalloomusSrfLandedLowlands = It's slightly brighter, you guess. But not severely bright.
		PalloomusSrfLandedCliff = You feel a sudden urge to get a stopwatch and time how long it takes you to fall.
		PalloomusSrfLandedSnowdrifts = It's powdery here. You can see your footprints as you launch into the air.

		EdasInSpaceHigh = You note that Edas resembles a slipper. Some people back at mission control chuckle.
		EdasInSpaceLow = Edas feels more like an equal than any other object you've visited. You can't help but imagine you are companions as you fly through interplanetary space together.
		EdasSrfLandedSurface = To say you are standing on Edas seems wrong; you're clinging onto it as you would a spacecraft.
		EdasSrfLandedCraters = You wonder how big a crater could get on an asteroid like this without the impact shattering it.
		EdasSrfLandedPolarCrater = If this impact had been any larger, you wonder if Edas would've been shattered.
		
		DopplerInSpaceHigh = Doppler reminds you of Grandma's cookies. They were awful cookies.
		DopplerInSpaceLow = This asteroid feels like Duna, but wrong. So wrong.
		DopplerSrfLandedCrater = Your footsteps seem to be somewhat rigid on here. But a little kick of a loose rock gives it its second, more transient moon.
		DopplerSrfLandedMainland = It feels like a fragment of Duna, except if you jumped you would head straight into orbit.
		DopplerSrfLandedEquator = This is white. How white.
		
		DyvaInSpaceHigh = Your mouth waters just looking at this.
		DyvaInSpaceLow = If space weren't a vacuum, you'd be tasting the surface right now.
		DyvaSrfLanded = You wish butter could exist at temperatures like this.
		DyvaSrfLanded = Your stomach starts to growl as you look at this.

		CrokslevInSpaceHigh = The goo glimmers, but gets shy and stops when it notices you looking.
		CrokslevInSpaceLow = The goo seems to be quite nervous.
		CrokslevSrfLanded = The goo glimmers, but a little confidently. When you look it only dims slightly.

		GeitoInSpaceHigh = The goo forms a series of complex shapes that you can't quite describe. It's quite horrifying, but you feel that it's trying to tell you something. Mission control tells you to snap out of it.
		GeitoInSpaceLow = It's a map, but it's not quite right yet. You can make out the position of Kerbin and its moons however. What does this mean?
		GeitoSrfLanded = The goo floats out the container, you see it begin to shape itself. But a geyser blasts it off into space, never to be seen again.

		Lint-MikeyInSpace = The goo wobbles and becomes a strange polygonal shape.
		Lint-MikeySrfLanded = The goo floats until it comes to rest on a chunk of ice. The chunk is then blasted into space by a geyser.

		ZoreInSpaceHigh = The goo turns orange and shatters.
		ZoreInSpaceLow = Pieces of goo chip away at the inside of the container.
		ZoreSrfLanded = The goo is hardened, as if inspired by Zore's hard metallic nature.

		VantInSpace = The goo seems to be planning something. Maybe you're just anxious.
		VantSrfLanded = The goo dissolves in a fizzy mess of bubbles.

		QuazenInSpace = The goo is tearing in two.
		QuazenSrfLanded = The goo is whole again. Then it broke again. Then it's whole again...

		EuribanneInSpace = The goo is running in place.
		EuribanneSrfLanded = The goo is worryingly still.

		Ki'KiSrfLanded = Some materials change color, but the rest don't do a thing.
		Ki'KiSrfLandedContactPoint = One of the materials zips out of the bay. You feel like something went wrong, so you don't tell mission control about that one.

		KalInSpaceHigh = Some of the materials glow brightly as the reflect light from Havous and its bright rings.
		KalInSpaceLow = Nothing happens, so you jolt the ship a little bit. One of the biosamples seem annoyed.
		KalSrfLanded = One of the crystals fall out and you lose sight of it among the diverse rocks of Kal's surface.
		KalSrfLandedPeaks = The materials glimmer in the bright light of Havous. You can't help but envy its ability to bring out the best in others.

		HavousInSpaceHigh = The materials swirl in the zero-G enviroment; you lose some of the samples to the vacuum of space.
		HavousInSpaceLow = There must have been some air trapped in the bay, because all of the materials got sucked out into space.
		HavousSrfLanded = While the materials are very dizzy, you can see that gravity may be influenced by Havous' rotation.
		HavousSrfLandedPoles = The materials are subject to the highest gravity Havous can offer, which still isn't that much.

		FlakeInSpaceHigh = The materials are getting chilly.
		FlakeInSpaceLow = One of the free-floating materials is hit by a micrometeorite and explodes into many fine grains.
		FlakeSrfLanded = Most of the liquids sublimate, aside from a small amount of Mystery Goo that was included in the bay. Figures.

		MracksisInSpaceHigh = The materials are very much still there, but aside from that seem to have only become heavily irradiated by the trip out here.
		MracksisInSpaceLow = Some of the ice samples have begun to darken, others have become pinkish.
		MracksisSrfLanded = Some of the ice samples have turned red. A lot of the samples have turned red. You realize that some fine powder-like dust was kicked into the bay by the engines upon landing. 
		MracksisSrfLandedIceFields = The materials don't seem to find Mracksis very hospitable.
		MracksisSrfLandedGlaciers = The materials are quite cold, and some of the softer samples dissolve.

		LonInSpace = The materials drift slowly out into the abyss, you can't help but pity them. They don't get to come back to Kerbin.
		LonSrfLanded = The samples froze over, it's not exactly a startling discovery, but now you know for sure that Lon is, in fact, cold.

		SodenInSpaceHigh = The samples haven't done a thing in a very long time, and even now after the bay doors open, nothing happens. It's a little sad.
		SodenInSpaceLow = The samples drift out into space, but some of them seem to sparkle before dissolving.
		SodenSrfLanded = The samples fall slowly out onto Soden's chilly surface. The one biosamples that survives tries to bury itself, but doesn't get very far before it too dies. You wonder if throwing biosamples into the universe is a bad plan.

		ArchaeInSpace = Something suddenly shoots out into space and tumbles as it does so. It seems a gas canister was burst by a corrosive acid. The materials bay is a mess.
		ArchaeSrfLanded = One of the samples drifts out, lands on Archae's surface, and sinks.

		ErvoInSpaceHigh = One of the materials begins to glow. It causes a stir among the scientific community, before it's pointed out to be a metallic material reflecting sunlight.
		ErvoInSpaceLow = The materials drift out into space and one can pick out several shapes in the resulting cloud of junk before it disperses.
		ErvoFlying = The materials fall out into the air; one of them sparks and catches fire.
		ErvoSrfLanded = All of the metallic samples rust instantly.
		ErvoSrfSplashed = Some of the materials heat up a lot due to the reactive oxygen ceasing an opportunity.

		CrokslevInSpace = Some of the materials seem to be reflective like the rings. You wonder if this can tell you more about the make-up of the rings. It's most likely water-ice.
		CrokslevSrfLanded = The materials seem quite bored, unable to appreciate where they are.

		GeitoInSpace = Some of the more reactive metals rust as water from Geito's coma gets into the bay. You're going to be drying out the bay for days.
		GeitoSrfLanded = What materals don't get blown away by the comet's ejections are rusting rapidly. Most of the materials shatter when a large rock is flung into the bay.

		Lint-MikeyInSpace = One of the biosamples seems to be quite amazed with the comet, then you realize it was just decompressing due to space being a vacuum.
		Lint-MikeySrfLanded = You've scattered random materials across the surface and nearby space of a comet. You wonder if this experiment was worth bringing.

		ZoreInSpace = You notice that some of the samples have become quite shiny, though the reasons why are unclear.
		ZoreSrfLanded = Some of the materials become quite brittle in a vacuum and crumble into fine dust.

		VantInSpace = The materials seem to like Vant, at least from orbit. If "liking" means remaining mostly unchanged of course.
		VantSrfLanded = The observations you make on Vant's surface, or any other low-gravity non-atmospheric body, should be very much what you'd expect to happen in the middle of space. And they are.

		QuazenInSpace = The light reflecting off the gems seems similar to the glints in the lake. Whatever it is, it sure isn't water.
		QuazenSrfLanded = Not any different from another vacuum body. The samples are, however, sadly lost on the surface.

		EuribanneInSpace = Nothing really changes once you open the bay, except for the lack of any materials to check anymore.
		EuribanneSrfLanded = It's just like any other low-gravity vacuum body, except out further away than the asteroid belt.

		EurbonInSpace = All that happens is a tiny little bit of glinting, and it's gone.
		EurbonSrfLanded = The materials sure are going to impact the surface alright.

		Palloocus-PalloomusInSpace = Looking at the materials here, there are certain things that may explain the different colorations of these bodies. But aside from that, there wasn't much value in opening this bay.
		Palloocus-PalloomusSrfLanded = The materials are forming into a ball at the barycenter. Please check with the developer for further information.

		PalloocusInSpace = Nothing really changes as a result of the opening of the bay, but you do know now that the surface is made mainly of water ice.
		PalloocusSrfLanded = There's now a patch of odd materials for future missions to never be able to detect.

		PalloomusInSpace = Palloomus may be made of tholins for sure, and the water ice samples do seem to be very similar to that of Palloocus. A reasonable investigation to be sure.
		PalloomusSrfLanded = The ice is lost onto the ground, changing the material diversity for a very slight moment.

		EdasInSpace = The materials seem relatively unchanged, apart from the usual decompression, boiling, freezing you would expect from a vacuum.
		EdasSrfLanded = Just bringing the bay here has brought Edas a great deal more material diversity than it has ever seen.
		
		DopplerInSpace = These materials haven't changed much, though a couple of metal samples have oxidized due to miniature ice impacts.
		DopplerSrfLanded = Well well. Seems like tholins might be the material of the day.
		
		DyvaInSpace = This is far from an intriguing destination.
		DyvaSrfLanded = With this "gravity," none of these materials are even going to impact Dyva except on geological timescales.

		Ki'KiInSpace = It's cold out here. Most substances found on Kerbin would be solid.
		Ki'KiSrfLanded = Ki'Ki seems to absorb a fair amount of heat, however it doesn't have any significant effects on the object. It radiates that heat from its dark side, raising questions about the long-term stability of Ki'Ki's orbit.

		KalInSpace = The low temperatures might allow for a large amount of volatiles to exist on Kal's surface.
		KalSrfLanded = Kal is very cold, like everything else in the Havous system, but the Havosian tides are heating it.
		KalSrfLandedLowlands = Kal's rubble fields are darker, and thus absorb slightly more heat.

		HavousInSpace = It's not exactly pleasant out here.
		HavousSrfLanded = Havous is the coldest body in its system.
		HavousSrfLandedScar = There's a little bit of heat trapped below the surface here.
		HavousSrfLandedPointZero = There's a fair amount of heat trapped below the surface here.

		FlakeInSpace = The low temperatures might imply that Flake is entirely volatiles, which has been suggested by some planetary scientists.
		FlakeSrfLanded = There is no internal heat at all coming from Flake.

		MracksisInSpace = The low temperatures are exactly as expected.
		MracksisSrfLanded = Mracksis is geologically dead, there's no heat coming from under ground.

		LonInSpace = This is one of the coldest locations ever seen.
		LonSrfLanded = As if it weren't cold enough in the day, it gets worse at night.

		SodenInSpace = The temperature drops very slowly as you continue to approach Soden.
		SodenInSpaceLow = It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder.
		SodenSrfLanded = One could wonder if Soden at its furthest point from the sun gets a significant fraction of heat from other stars. When you suggest that idea people laugh at you, and you realize just how far the other stars really are.
		SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = Soden isn't quite dead yet; there's a hotspot in this region.

		ArchaeInSpace = Yep, it's pretty cold.
		ArchaeSrfLanded = There's a faint heat coming from below the ground. Heat from a more recent impact event maybe.

		ErvoInSpace = Brr.
		ErvoFlying = The cold air causes a layer of frost to build up on the thermometer. Many people doubted an atmosphere could ever exist out here, yet here it is.
		ErvoSrfLanded = It's often debated whether or not Ervo could host any form of light weather despite the low solar energy levels. Checking the temperature just casts more doubt on that idea.
		ErvoSrfSplashed = It's just barely too hot for liquid oxygen on the surface of the lakes, it seems that Ervo is slowly losing its oxygen. Who knows how much it might've had in the past.
		ErvoSrfLandedPoles = It's just cold enough for stable oxygen ice here, this may be the only permanent oxygen on Ervo.
		ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = There's some subsurface heating here.
		ErvoSrfLandedSmoothGlacierField = There's some subsurface heating here.
		ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = There's some subsurface heating here.
		ErvoSrfLandedMountains = Temperature lowers with elevation, just like on Kerbin.

		CrokslevInSpace = It's cold enough for methane to freeze out here. Perhaps we'll find some?
		CrokslevSrfLanded = The objects has warm days and frigid nights.

		GietoInSpace = It's a cool place, but as the comet approaches Kerbol, it's going to get a whole lot hotter.
		GietoSrfLanded = As the comet warms up, things are getting more exciting, geysers erupt, the coma gets larger, and the heartrate of everyone at mission control gets way faster.

		Lint-MikeyInSpace = As Lint-Mikey orbits the sun, it experiences a lot of temperature shifting. It gets colder than Vall at its furthest, and almost as warm as the Mun at its closest.
		Lint-MikeySrfLanded = The comet shows no signs of internal heating. Its geysers only erupt on the day side however.

		ZoreInSpace = You know, measuring the temperature of space seems to be impossible and what-not, but the craft itself does get warmer or colder based on where it is in the Solar System, which is probably a much more helpful reading to take. For instance, here it's cold enough for ice to exist, though large ice deposits might not survive unless and object had permanantly shadowed regions, or a high gravitational pull. Thus, one can hypothesize that Zore will have little to no ice.
		ZoreSrfLanded = The temperature changes drastically as Zore rotates.

		VantInSpace = Vant being icy seems strange. Perhaps it formed much further from Kerbol than it is now.
		VantSrfLanded = During the day, Vant's surface is too hot for ice to survive. You wonder if this means that as Vant moved inwards, it had an atmosphere, or even a giant comet-like tail.

		QuazenInSpace = The interlobes seem to be somewhat stressed compared to the outer regions. There may be geological activity at bay.
		QuazenSrfLanded = The surface is somewhat warmer than expected, suggesting at least some geological activity.

		EuribanneInSpace = The surface has about the temperature expected from a body out this far. Stay frosty, Euribanne.
		EuribanneSrfLanded = There's a decent amount of terperature variation based on shadows. Just like is expected.

		EurbonInSpace = Out here it's pretty chilly, and Eurbon is just as chilly as expected.
		EurbonSrfLanded = The nighttime is pretty chilly out here, huh?
		EurbonSrfLandedPits = If these are permanently shadowed, there may very well be solid deposits of materials around there.

		Palloocus-PalloomusInSpace = This is a chilly space for sure, but not unexpectedly chilly.

		PalloocusInSpace = Just like expected, a reflective body like this is incredibly cool for its distance from the Sun.
		PalloocusSrfLanded = Brr...
		PalloocusSrfLandedBloodCrater = This is kind of balmy... compared to the rest of the body.
		PalloocusSrfLandedVolcano = Somehow these are so much warmer than the rest of the body... are they still active?

		PalloomusInSpace = This is certainly warmer than Palloocus, but average for any body of this distance.
		PalloomusSrfLanded = Thermal radiation seems to be going a bit hotter than expected, but why would you expect anything else from here?
		PalloomusSrfLandedSnowdrifts = Since this region reflects more light, it is a bit cooler than the rest of the body. Not too hard to handle, however.

		EdasInSpace = Edas gets a fair amount of seasonal heating and cooling due to its eccentric orbit.
		EdasSrfLanded = Edas' surface changes drastically in temperature due to its lack of atmosphere. The heat radiating off the surface during the night might be able to move Edas slowly, like a very low energy thruster.
		
		DopplerInSpace = Doppler is surprisingly cold for an asteroid of its size.
		DopplerSrfLanded = Yes, this is somewhat chilly. Gets a bit warmer at the equators... perhaps there's a bit of tidal action going on, however subtle there is.
		
		DyvaInSpace = The usual reflection from an asteroid, with somewhat seasonal heating.
		DyvaSrfLanded = The shadowed regions are incredibly cold, consistent with a tiny body like this. The solar wind must have a major effect on the motion of this asteroid.

		KalSrfLanded = There's no atmosphere here after all. Glad that mystery is solved.

		HavousInSpace = There's nothing out here to read.
		HavousSrfLanded = We think Havous might have flung its atmosphere into space.

		FlakeInSpace = Well, if you count the occasional bit of dust or micrometeorite, then there's something here. The instrument however, reads zero flat.
		FlakeSrfLanded = Flake and objects like it could never hold an atmosphere according to all models. This observation confirms those models.

		MracksisInSpace = There's not much to see here, and there's no atmosphere either.
		MracksisSrfLanded = There's a very, very thin exosphere.

		LonInSpace = Well, no atmosphere to be found.
		LonSrfLanded = You find the lack of atmosphere disturbing.

		SodenInSpace = Atmospheres don't usually stretch this far into space. The one you're trying to measure doesn't even exist.
		SodenSrfLanded = What atmosphere used to be there is frozen now. So let it go.
		SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = There's a very occasional tick on the barometer. There might be a very thin, local exosphere here.

		ArchaeInSpace = No atmosphere to be found.
		ArchaeSrfLanded = There's a lack of atmosphere, which to some scientists is quite shocking, due to Ervo's atmosphere being very much real.

		ErvoInSpace = You're not going to read any atmosphere yet.
		ErvoFlyingHigh = There's an atmosphere here, it's very thin.
		ErvoFlyingLow = The atmosphere is the thickest observed beyond Plock, but that's not saying much.
		ErvoSrfLanded = Yes, this is a "thick" atmosphere. Not nearly enough to breathe in, but enough to at least be an atmosphere.

		Crokslev = There's a good search effort put towards finding any exosphere at all, but none is ever found.

		Geito = The coma's density can be measured with this barometer, but it has to be used very carefully to do so.

		Lint-Mikey = The coma's density can be measured with this barometer, but it has to be used extremely carefully to do so.

		ZoreInSpace = There's nothing out here, it's unlikely Zore would have any atmosphere at all.
		ZoreSrfLanded = Zore has no atmosphere at all.

		VantInSpace = It would be quite a surprise if even the second-biggest asteroid had any resonable atmosphere, so far it looks like Vant doesn't.
		VantSrfLanded = Nothing to see here. Disappointing, but unsurprising.

		QuazenInSpace = Whatever atmosphere this may have had would have been flung off by the sheer speed of its rotation.
		QuazenSrfLanded = Thin exosphere caused by cosmic ray reactions, but too little to even consider.

		Euribanne = It's too low-gravity to hold even a subtle atmosphere here. Maybe if something knocked it out and brought it toward the Sun, it'd get a coma, but who would expect a coma from something like this?

		Eurbon = Seems like there's nothing at all! Nothing at all! Nothing at all!!

		Palloocus-Palloomus = From this distance, you wouldn't expect to see any atmosphere aside from a very faint coma, but these are far enough from the sun that one wouldn't form anyway.

		PalloocusInSpace = There doesn't seem to be anything in this region...
		PalloocusSrfLanded = There may be a thin exosphere of water vapor caused by the sublimation of the particles, but nothing more.

		Palloomus = It's very tiny. Not much to see for atmosphere.

		Edas = There's nothing at all here.
		
		Doppler = A bit of venting, but nothing else.
		
		Dyva = Observe, the atmosphere of a butter cookie.

		Ki'KiSrfLandedMajorLobe = This lobe has a slightly higher mass than its twin.
		Ki'KiSrfLandedMinorLobe = This lobe has a slightly lower mass than its twin.
		Ki'KiSrfLandedContactPoint = There's a slight pull from either side of the craft coming from the lobes.

		KalInSpace = Even this close to Kal, there's still a strong pull from Havous; well, a relatively strong pull.
		KalSrfLanded = There is some doubt about the stablity of Kal. You're tearing it apart, Havous!

		HavousInSpace = Havous is pretty small, so the pull isn't incredible. Nevertheless, it's still enough for Havous to host moons and a ring system.
		HavousSrfLanded = The gravity on Havous is quite strange. Due to its rotation and shape, the closer you go to the poles, the stronger gravity gets.
		HavousSrfLandedPoles = This is the strongest surface gravity Havous has to offer, and even then it's not much.

		FlakeInSpace = It's shocking this moon can even hold itself together.
		FlakeSrfLanded = Mracksis is expected to rip Flake apart in the near future, well, near in astronomical terms.

		MracksisInSpace = Mracksis' gravity is slightly weaker than the Mun's.
		MracksisSrfLanded = The surface gravity is ever so slightly higher than expected, Mracksis might have a very small rocky core.

		LonInSpace = Observe, the gravitational strength of a potato.
		LonInSpace = It's not much, but it's enough for Lon.
		LonSrfLanded = Lon's orbit is slightly off. It's so slight that it could never have been noticed from Kerbin, it might not have even been noticable from Soden. Perhaps there's another tug?

		SodenInSpace = Soden is so far from Kerbol, that even its minimal gravity has a huge SOI. It's a wonder that Soden has only capture one moon. Or perhaps... it only has one KNOWN moon?
		SodenInSpaceLow = There's a slight tug that doesn't fit with Soden or Lon, it's miniscule but it shouldn't be there.
		SodenSrfLanded = This was an easy landing. The gravity here is really low.

		ArchaeInSpace = This is the second largest moon known around a dwarf planet, it's gravity is similar to that of Minmus.
		ArchaeSrfLanded = The readings bug out for a few seconds before correcting themselves.

		ErvoInSpace = Behold, the gravity of the largest dwarf planet.
		ErvoFlying = Ervo has just enough gravity to hold its thin atmosphere in place, but it seems to be losing it slowly to space.
		ErvoSrfLanded = It's impressive how little worlds with little gravity can hold a fair amount in place.
		ErvoSrfSplashed = Good thing these sensors detect particles instead of force; the buoyancy counteracts the force of gravity slightly.

		CrokslevInSpace = There's not much to be found, yet this object holds rings.
		CrokslevSrfLanded = How could an impact ever be so gentle that it allowed material to be captured by such a small object?

		GeitoInSpace = You're not quite familiar with measuring using micro-gees, but you have to here.
		GeitoSrfLanded = This gravity is probably not going to do a very good job of holding you down.

		Lint-MikeyInSpace = You are able to measure the micro-gee enviroment here up to four decimal places, this should help find a stable orbit to park in.
		Lint-MikeySrfLanded = With such low gravity, you should really consider attaching to Lint-Mikey instead of hoping for the best.

		ZoreInSpace = With new, more accurate observations of its shape, size, and gravity data, one can immediately confirm that Zore is, as long suspected, made of heavy metals.
		ZoreSrfLanded = Zore's surface gravity is quite high for objects of its size, but it's exactly what was expected for a metal world.

		VantInSpace = By looking at the low gravity of Vant and comparing it with its size, it's quite easy to figure out that Vant is mostly ice.
		VantSrfLanded = Vant's surface gravity is quite low for an object of its size, but it's exactly what you'd expect for an ice world.

		QuazenInSpace = Quazen's got some pretty high gravity for its size, but based on its incredible spin speed it might not have that much gravity in the lobes.
		QuazenSrfLanded = There's a strong pull toward the interlobe region, but the lobes themselves are pretty low-gravity.
		QuazenSrfLandedInterlobe = Welp. This sure is a dense region.

		EuribanneInSpace = It's Gilly-like microgravity, except with a larger sphere of influence due to being its own body and further from the Sun.
		EuribanneSrfLanded = Drop something on there, and it'll fall for minutes before reaching the ground.
		
		EuribanneInSpace = Microgravity meets microgravity. Somehow this is massive enough to work really well for gravity assists though.
		EuribanneSrfLanded = This little moon needs a harpoon.

		PalloocusInSpace = Compared to Palloomus, this asteroid seems to be slightly fluffier and less dense.
		PalloocusSrfLanded = This was a mildly easy landing, but still somewhat easy to handle.

		PalloomusInSpace = This is slightly denser than Palloocus, but it's not a severe difference.
		PalloomusSrfLanded = The gravity field seems to be pretty low.
		PalloomusSrfLandedCliff = It's a really low-gravity region here, by virtue of being the highest as well.

		EdasInSpace = Not much to be seen in terms of gravity. How much is the ship pulling Edas as opposed to Edas pulling the craft?
		EdasSrfLanded = The microgravity is the opposite of intense. Some form of coupling to Edas is recommended.

		DopplerInSpace = The craft may be messing with Dyva's orbit somewhat...
		DopplerSrfLanded = By landing here, you may have accidentally set this asteroid on a future collision course. Shame on you.

		HavousSrfLanded = Havous seems to be geologically dead.

		SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = This seems to be the origin of the small tremors; the subsurface lakes must be freezing over.

		ArchaeSrfLanded = Archae is far enough away to avoid any tidal stress from Ervo, so how did Archae's surface get the way it is now?

		ErvoSrfLanded = There are weak tremors here on Ervo. This is a geologically active world for sure.
		ErvoSrfLandedMountains = This is a convergent boundary. Ervo might have a liquid interior globally.
		ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = There's some strong activity here, this may be a thin area in the crust above the subsurface ocean.
		ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = There's a good amount of activity under this area.
		ErvoSrfLandedSmoothGlacierField = There's a good amount of activity under this area.

		CrokslevSrfLanded = Crokslev seems to be completely dead. At least, it will be until Sarnus or Urlum sends it closer to the system.

		GeitoSrfLanded = You can detect rather large eruptions as the comet approches the Sun.

		Lint-MikeySrfLanded = You can detect faint blips as geysers erupt from the comet.

		ZoreSrfLanded = Zore seems to be dead geologically.
		ZoreSrfLandedCraggleFields = Although the rest of the evidence has been lost to time, this region may prove that Zore was at one point active.

		VantSrfLanded = Vant's seismic activity is a flatline. Darn shame; the surface suggests that Vant was at one point very active.

		QuazenSrfLanded = Something's churning somewhat inside, but it might just be because of the rotation.
		QuazenSrfLandedInterlobe = There's nothing here. The activity must be in the lobes.
		QuazenSrfLandedNorthPole = There's nothing here. The activity must be in the lobes.
		QuazenSrfLandedSouthPole = There's nothing here. The activity must be in the lobes.

		EuribanneSrfLanded = Something of this size is unlikely to have geological activity. But then why is the chasm there?
		
		EurbonSrfLanded = It seems like you've reached a dead, dead world.

		Palloocus-PalloomusSrfLanded = The sensor has been crushed by the sheer gravity here. Please check with the developer for further information.

		PalloocusSrfLanded = As much as those cryovolcanoes would like to make you think, this world is dead. Or at least dormant... there seems to be something in there.

		PalloomusSrfLanded = This world is not only merely dead, it is truly most sincerely dead!

		EdasSrfLanded = Edas is very dead, it's unlikely it ever had any activity at all. You consider the funds wasted on this experiment.
		
		DopplerSrfLanded = Teeny tiny bit of venting and tidal action, but otherwise not really much to write home about.
		
		DyvaSrfLanded = Is this really the world you expect to be geologically active?

		ErvoFlyingHigh = The atmosphere here seems to be made of traces of nitrogen.
		ErvoFlyingLow = Still just a bit of nitrogen, but significant amounts of neon, oxygen, and hydrogen as well.
		ErvoSrfLanded = There seems to be a fair amount of oxygen and ammonia in the lower atmosphere, at least at lower altitudes. This suggests that Ervo may undergo an oxygen cycle, just like the water cycle on Kerbin or the explodium cycle on Eve.
		ErvoSrfLandedMountains = The ammonia seems to be freezing here, falling like snow.
		ErvoSrfLandedCoastalBasins = Any gaseous oxygen that may have been here is beginning to condense onto the craft.
		ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = There seem to be subtle hints of water vapor in the atmosphere. Perhaps this is due to volcanism?
		ErvoSrfLandedMajorGlacierField = There seem to be subtle hints of water vapor in the atmosphere. Perhaps this is due to volcanism?
		ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = There seem to be subtle hints of water vapor in the atmosphere. Perhaps this is due to volcanism?
		ErvoSrfSplashed = The warranty is void now that you've submerged it in LIQUID OXYGEN.

		Ki'KiInSpace = The instrument reads zero.
		Ki'KiSrfLanded = Still nothing to see here. Must be devoid of metals.

		KalInSpace = Havous' magnetic field ever-so-subtly distorts here.
		KalSrfLanded = A statistically significant increase in magnetic activity here.

		HavousInSpaceHigh = Havous' magnetic field is relatively faint here.
		HavousInSpaceLow = The magnetic field here seems unusually strong, perhaps due to its incredibly rapid rotation. It also seems misaligned with the spin of the dwarf planet, and the rings cause teeny little dips in activity.
		HavousSrfLanded = The magnetic field here is slightly weaker than in space. There must be radiation belts of some sort.
		HavousSrfLandedPointZero = Whatever impacted Havous must have been extremely metallic; pure iron, even. If so, how did it even get out here?

		FlakeInSpace = Not even a slight change in magnetic activity.
		FlakeSrfLanded = Dead.

		MracksisInSpaceHigh = There's no magnetic field to speak of here.
		MracksisInSpaceLow = Slight variations in magnetic attraction occur as you pass over the maria, but nothing else to see.
		MracksisSrfLanded = This instrument may as well have been used for lithobraking.
		MracksisSrfLandedMaria = The magnetic materials, where there are any, seem to be pointing toward… the spacecraft?

		LonInSpace = No real magnetism to be seen here.
		LonSrfLanded = Very little here to talk home about, just typical random magnetism.

		SodenInSpace = There are some hints of magnetic activity in the region.
		SodenInSpaceLow = Little to speak home about here, just a general alignment of things, although what little magnetosphere there is must be misaligned.
		SodenSrfLanded = The mangetic particles here seem to point to a spot halfway between the northern hemisphere and the equator.
		SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = This seems to be the magnetic pole.

		ArchaeInSpace = This moon seems to be pretty high in heavy metals like iron, sodium, and… neodymium? Inconceivable!
		ArchaeSrfLanded = This magnetism is probably too much to take at this point.

		ErvoInSpaceHigh = This planet may or may not have an iron core. There seems to be some sort of faint magnetism here.
		ErvoInSpaceLow = Whatever magnetism might have been here may be coming mostly from Archae, but there are still deep hints of it close to Ervo.
		ErvoFlying = I know this atmosphere is thin, but did you have to open the magnetometer HERE?
		ErvoSrfLanded = We've got some magnetism alright. Even on the anti-Archaean side.

		CrokslevInSpace = Not much of a magnetic field to see here; this world is geologically dead.
		CrokslevSrfLanded = Yep, this is a dead, dead world.

		GeitoInSpace = Not much to see here; maybe a teeny bit of background magnetism, or magnetism from the craft.
		GeitoSrfLanded = There is nothing magnetic here.

		LintMikeyInSpace = The surface is oddly magnetic for a comet. It's still tiny, but significantly not tiny.
		LintMikeySrfLanded = How this magnetism evolved is beyond us all.

		VantInSpace = A trace magnetic field generated by slight variations in distribution of ice, but there's still nothing else major here.
		VantSrfLanded = The ice here is shifting a bit, but whatever is left in there is tiny at best.

		ZoreInSpace = A substantial magnetic field around here. It must be incredibly high in metal content.
		ZoreSrfLanded = This is the most magnetic asteroid that we've seen yet.

		QuazenInSpace = There does seem to be a magnetic field here, however subtle.
		QuazenSrfLanded = This magnetism is sure unexpected for an asteroid of its size... how does this happen?

		Euribanne = It's a tiny, non-magnetic body. Why was this instrument even brought here?

		Eurbon = What can be gained from scanning a tiny rock?

		Palloocus-Palloomus = Little if any magnetic field to be seen here.

		Palloocus = There might be a hint of a magnetosphere, but that could also be water vapor hitting the boom itself. It could also be detecting some churning inside...

		Palloomus = That's not a very magnetic mody at all.

		Edas = Nothing here at all.

		Doppler = Observe, the magnetism of a cookie.

		Dyva = A fridge magnet has more magnetism than this.
