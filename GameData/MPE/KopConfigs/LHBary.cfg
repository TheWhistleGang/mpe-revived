			description = Lemus and Hizie are twins in all but name. In fact, they were named after husband-and-wife astronomers Lemus and Hizie Kerman, who helped to discover many bodies such as Havous, Soden, and more. Better still, stellar occultations have revealed an incredibly dynamic ring around them, keeping them wed for possibly eternity... or at least until another moon forms from the debris. Some have suggested that the two may merge into a contact binary somewhere down the line; but how far down the line is is anyone's guess.
