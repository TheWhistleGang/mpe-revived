			description = Palloocus and Palloomus are by far the largest trojan asteroids. While Palloomus was only discovered recently due to its dark coloration, Palloocus has been known for slightly less time than Pol has. These twins were named after the twin kings of Azlabin, an ancient kingdom that split into two due to a dispute about butter.
