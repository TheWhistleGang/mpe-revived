	{
		LookingAtDoppler = It looks like a chunk of Duna blown off from an impact.
		LookingAtVant = Quite the cute little fella there. Very brown.
		LookingAtZore = Interesting strip of orange over there...
		LookingAtQuazen = The reflectors might be off... or it's actually a two-toned asteroid.
		LookingAtEuribanne = That's a good-looking asteroid.
		LookingAtPalloocus = Hey, what's that red thing doing over there?
		LookingAtPalloomus = Hey, what's that white thing doing over there?
		LookingAtCrokslev = Hmm. Nice little rings.
		LookingAtHavous = It sure looks oblate, but maybe a bit more oblate than expected.
		LookingAtLemus = Wait, why is there a giant red halo around it?
		LookingAtMracksis = It's redder than Duna, and that's saying something.
		LookingAtErvo = Hey, what are those bright stripes on the surface?
		LookingAtArchae = That's ominous.
		LookingAtSoden = We didn't expect it to be this bright. But we also didn't expect that little speck over there.
