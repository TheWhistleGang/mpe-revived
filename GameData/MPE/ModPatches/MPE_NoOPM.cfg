	@Body[Crokslev]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			description = Crokslev is the largest member of the "centaurs," a group of asteroids that wander around the orbits of the outer planets. Not much is known about Crokslev, as most would rather consider Eeloo for missions. However, the recent discovery of rings around this object gave it several headlines and now the scientific community is finally starting to bat an eye towards the large, icy asteroid.

	@Body[Lemus]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			description = Lemus is an Eelino named after Lemus Kerman, one of the prime members of the Kerbal Astronomical Society, who helped to discover bodies such as Havous, Plock, and Mracksis. It's locked in a dance with Hizie, named after Lemus' wife, and Pava, named after his son.

	@Body[Havous]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			description = Havous was formerly known as Eeloo's little sister. But some recent discoveries have caused it to be called its weirdest cousin instead. Its squished shape and that dark patch on its surface, found through light-curve analysis, are at the very least one part of that.

	@Body[Ervo]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			description = Ervo is the second-most massive known object beyond the orbit of Jool. Its discovery and size, comparable to Eeloo's, have called into question Eeloo's planetary status. Numerous fight-related injuries are now directly tied to Ervo's existence.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		@CrokslevSrfLandedSouthernPile = These mounds are identical to one another, they must all have the same origin. Though how the object broke up before landing on Crokslev is a mystery. Perhaps the object was broken up by Jool? That would imply Crokslev was once much closer to these major planets, perhaps even a moon at some point in its past.
		
		@EuribanneSrfLandedDoubleDouble = These craters seem to be filled with tholins. Perhaps two objects beyond Jool came here and impacted the object.
		
		@PalloocusSrfLandedNorthHemi = A healthy mix of ice and tholins, enough to feed a whole Eeloonean family!

	{
		@ErvoInSpaceHigh = You're reminded that Ervo is the reason behind the controversy behind Eeloo, and you feel an slight irrational resentment because of that. Then you remember that Ervo is the reason behind Dres' promotion to a dwarf planet. You can't tell if that makes you angrier or not.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		@ErvoInSpaceHigh = You take a moment to consider every previous mission you can remember. From the Mun, to Jool, to Eeloo, to beyond, the space program just keeps going further. You look at the stars, and wonder how far away they truly are.
		@ErvoSrfLanded = You wonder if people will ever live in bases, or even colonies, on worlds beyond Plock. You chuckle, there's no way someone would be that crazy. Right?
		
		@CrokslevSrfLanded = You wish you had a telescope; Jool must be beautiful from here. You feel a little dizzy at the idea of seeing Kerbin from out here, only to identify a blue dot near the sun.

	{
		@CrokslevSrfLanded = Crokslev seems to be completely dead. At least, it will be until Jool sends it closer to the system.
